/*My employees keep fighting because they all want to grab donuts from the same tray at once 😡.
Sometimes two people grab the same donut. Other times, no one restocks and the tray is empty!
Can you build me a little simulation to show how my staff can stop fighting and work in harmony?
I don’t care about your fancy ‘Java’ terms – I just want to see:**
 🍩 A tray where donuts are added & taken
👨‍🍳 A baker who refills donuts
👩‍💼👨‍💼 Staff who take donuts to serve customers
🚦 Everyone waiting their turn (no crashes!)
Make it fun, show me in the console, and prove it won’t crash if 10 people rush in.”*/
